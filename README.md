# NRFA-rain-gauge-heights-vs-floods
Examples comparing the proportion of rain falling at given altitudes during/before flood events in FDRI catchments (Severn and Tweed).

## Severn catchment
[Bewdley](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54001) is used as the main catchment

Compared with three high altitude sites: [Dolwen](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54080),  [Abermule](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54014) and [Plynlimon Flume](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54022)

**Headline finding:**
X% of the rain is above a height of X

## Tweed catchment
[Norham](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21009) is used as the main catchment

Compared with two high altitude sites: [Kingledores](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21014) and [Fruid Water](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21001)

**Headline finding:**
X% of the rain is above a height of X
