# NRFA-rain-gauge-heights-vs-floods
Examples comparing the proportion of rain falling at given altitudes during/before flood events in FDRI catchments (Severn and Tweed).

## Severn catchment
[Bewdley](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54001) is used as the main catchment

Compared with three high altitude sites: [Abermule](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54014), [Dolwen](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54080) and [Plynlimon Flume](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54022).

**Headline finding:**
X% of the rain is above a height of X

| Height (m) |	Area of catchment above that height (%)	| Rainfall (%) | diff |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| 0.0 | 100.00 | 100.000 | 0.000 |
| 50.0 | 98.47 | 98.79 | -0.316 |
| 100.0 | 64.00 | 72.04 | -8.040 |
| 150.0 | 42.27 | 53.04 | -10.774 |
| 200.0 | 31.23 | 41.94 | -10.706 |
| 250.0 | 22.87 | 32.60 | -9.730 |
| 300.0 | 16.13 | 24.20 | -8.072 |
| 350.0 | 10.37 | 16.49 | -6.122 |
| 400.0 | 6.46 | 10.91 | -4.448 |
| 450.0 | 3.54 | 6.28 |	-2.740 |
| 500.0 | 1.62 | 3.00 |	-1.378 |

| 600.0 | 0.30 | 0.56 |	-0.264 |
| 650.0 | 0.09 | 0.17 |	-0.080 |
| 700.0 | 0.05 | 0.09 |	-0.038 |

## Tweed catchment
[Norham](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21009) is used as the main catchment

Compared with two high altitude sites: [Fruid Water](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21001) and [Kingledores](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21014).

**Headline finding:**
X% of the rain is above a height of X
